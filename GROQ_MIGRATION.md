# Research Gap Analysis Migration: Ollama to Groq AI

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the research gap analysis functionality from Ollama to Groq AI.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Groq Service (`src/services/groqService.ts`)
- Created a new service module for integrating with Groq AI
- Implements chat completion functionality using the Groq SDK
- Includes functions for:
  - `generateChatCompletion()` - Core Groq API interaction
  - `testGroqConnection()` - Connection testing
  - `extractFutureWorkDirections()` - Extract research directions from papers
  - `generateResearchGaps()` - Generate research gaps using AI analysis
  - Fallback text parsing when JSON parsing fails

### 2. Updated Research Gap Service (`src/services/researchGapService.ts`)
- Removed all Ollama-related code including:
  - `checkOllamaAvailability()` function
  - Ollama API calls in `extractFutureWork()` and `generateResearchGaps()`
  - Ollama-specific utility functions
- Updated imports to use the new Groq service
- Simplified functions to delegate AI operations to Groq service
- Comments updated to reference Groq AI instead of Ollama

### 3. Updated Research Gap Analysis Component (`src/components/ResearchGapAnalysis.tsx`)
- Replaced `testOllamaConnection()` with `testGroqAIConnection()`
- Updated button text from "Test Ollama" to "Test Groq AI"
- Updated loading message to reference Groq AI
- Updated toast messages for Groq AI testing

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Added `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` to `.env.example`
- Updated `.env` file to include Groq API key placeholder
- Added instructions for obtaining Groq API key

### 5. Dependencies
- Added `groq-sdk` package to project dependencies
- Version: `^0.32.0`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Groq API Key
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key

### 2. Configure Environment
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if not already done)
2. Add your Groq API key to the `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` variable:
   ```
   VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
   ```

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Research Gap Analysis component
3. Click "Test Groq AI" to verify the connection
4. Select a paper and click "Analyze Gaps" to run a full analysis

## Benefits of the Migration

### 1. Cloud-Based Service
- No need to install and run local Ollama service
- Eliminates dependency management issues
- Works across different development environments

### 2. Better Performance
- Groq provides optimized inference for fast response times
- No local hardware requirements
- Reliable uptime and availability

### 3. Easier Setup
- Simple API key configuration
- No model downloads or management
- Browser-compatible SDK

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages and debugging
- More reliable connection testing
- Graceful fallbacks for parsing issues

## API Usage

The Groq service uses the `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model by default, which provides:
- High-quality research analysis
- Good JSON formatting compliance
- Fast response times
- Cost-effective usage

Note: The original `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` model was decommissioned, so we've updated to the newer `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model which is actively supported.

## Cost Considerations

- Groq offers competitive pricing for API usage
- Monitor usage through the Groq console
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Future Enhancements

1. **Model Selection**: Add configuration to choose different Groq models
2. **Caching**: Implement response caching to reduce API calls
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add request throttling for production environments
4. **Error Recovery**: Enhanced retry logic for failed requests
5. **Usage Analytics**: Track API usage and costs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot find module 'groq-sdk'"**
   - Run `npm install groq-sdk`
   - Restart the development server

2. **"VITE_GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is required"**
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file
   - Ensure the variable name is exactly `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY`

3. **"Groq API failed" errors**
   - Verify your API key is valid
   - Check your internet connection
   - Review the Groq console for usage limits

4. **"Model has been decommissioned" errors**
   - This happens when using outdated model names
   - The code now uses `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (current production model)
   - Check the [Groq models page](https://console.groq.com/docs/models) for latest models

5. **JSON parsing errors**
   - The system includes fallback text parsing
   - Check the debug information tab for details
   - These are usually handled gracefully

## Migration Verification

To verify the migration was successful:
1. ✅ Build passes without errors: `npm run build`
2. ✅ Test connection works with valid API key
3. ✅ Research gap analysis generates results
4. ✅ No references to Ollama remain in the codebase
5. ✅ Error handling works for invalid API keys

Chapter 1: Introduction

This is the introduction chapter of our project. We will discuss the background, motivation, and objectives of our research work.

The main goal of this project is to develop an automated document processing system that can convert Word documents into properly formatted LaTeX reports.

This system will help students and researchers to quickly generate professional-looking academic reports without having to learn LaTeX formatting.

Chapter 2: Literature Review

In this chapter, we review the existing literature and related work in the field of document processing and automatic formatting.

Several researchers have worked on document conversion tools. However, most existing solutions are either too complex or don't maintain proper formatting.

Our approach combines AI-powered content analysis with template-based LaTeX generation to achieve better results.

Chapter 3: Methodology

This chapter describes the methodology used in our project.

We use a multi-step approach:
1. Document parsing and content extraction
2. AI-powered chapter identification and structuring
3. LaTeX template-based report generation
4. Quality assurance and validation

The system is built using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend interface.

Chapter 4: Implementation

The implementation consists of several key components:

Backend API: Built with FastAPI, handles file uploads and processing
AI Integration: Uses Groq AI for intelligent document analysis
Template System: LaTeX templates for consistent formatting
Frontend Interface: React-based user interface for easy interaction

Chapter 5: Results and Testing

Our testing shows that the system can successfully process various document formats and generate well-formatted LaTeX reports.

The system maintains chapter structure, preserves content formatting, and handles images appropriately.

User feedback has been positive, with users appreciating the ease of use and professional output quality.

Chapter 6: Conclusion

In conclusion, we have successfully developed an automated document processing system that converts Word documents to LaTeX format.

The system demonstrates good performance in maintaining document structure and generating professional-looking reports.

Future work will focus on improving image processing and adding support for more document formats.
